## Official Site

"[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files."

## Tips and Tricks
- consider using .gitignore for .obsidian/cache, rather than .obsidian
- [How to do block referencing in Obsidian](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-do-block-referencing-in-obsidian/831) - "if you want block level referencing, in Obsidian, you just need to wrap the blocks youâ€™re targeting with `[[ ]]`. Then create the new note.""
	- also see lots of interesting ideas at [Block reference](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/block-reference/674/84)

## Wishlist
- optional filepath display for each page - maybe in the right sidebar?
- inter-vault links, so you can have a "private" vault and "public" vault, with links between them (perhaps with `obsidian:`?)
- back-arrow, to move from page you're viewing, to previous page you were viewing
	- (this is currently a keyboard shortcut, but with no visible UI)
- "base" or "global" settings, and/or an easy way to copy settings to a new vault
- when clicking the close window in macOS, close the window but don't exit the program (macOS standard behavior)
- regular macOS Window menu
