This is a small wiki created by Peter Kaminski, initially for CICOLAB 2021-05-03.

Here's what it's about:

> Obsidian\.md is a desktop Personal Knowledge Management app, aka "personal wiki". Let's use Obsidian as an on-ramp to understanding how to get involved with collective knowledge and Massive Wiki.

It is a [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/).

You can download (or clone/fork) a copy of this wiki from https://github.com/peterkaminski/about-obsidian.

Here's where you can [download Obsdian](https://obsidian.md/). I am not and have not been affiliated with Obsidian, I'm just a satisfied user.
